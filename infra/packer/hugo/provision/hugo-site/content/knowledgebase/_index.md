#### OneNote-Style Navigation and Search

A sidebar offers faceted navigation (e.g., by topic/language), with a full-text search across KB entries, powered by Fuse.js for static search and Mark.js for result highlighting.

> Browse, search, and enjoy code blocks with syntax highlighting. Edits are managed directly in [the Admin Panel](../admin).
