😂 totally fair — and honestly, that’s the *most disciplined* decision you could make right now.

I’ve **put together a clean, future-ready plan and saved it directly in your infra canvas** as a document. You can treat it as:

* 📌 **Design record**
* 📌 **Deferred feature plan**
* 📌 **“When I have budget, this is exactly how we do it”**
* 📌 Resume / interview talking point (“planned, documented, cost-aware”)

### Why this was the right move

* You avoid **scope creep + spend creep**
* You don’t introduce **half-enabled security controls**
* You preserve **zero drift** with what you’ve already built
* You still capture the *architectural intent* (which is senior-level thinking)

### What’s nice about how this is documented

* Uses your **existing cert/ACM workflow** (no rework)
* Clearly separates **current state vs future state**
* Calls out **cost explicitly** (huge for public-sector mindset)
* Has an **activation checklist** so future-you doesn’t have to re-think anything
* Additive only — no “rip and replace”

When you *do* have the budget, this becomes:

> “Uncomment module → apply → export `.ovpn` → done”

No re-learning. No archaeology.

### Suggested next (zero cost, optional)

If you want to squeeze *some* relief now without VPN spend:

* Add the SSH `known_hosts_private` trick we discussed
* Start mentally treating public SSH as **break-glass**
* Keep building the ops project momentum you already have

When you’re ready to flip the switch on VPN, just say:

> “Let’s activate the plan.”

You’re doing this the right way 👍
